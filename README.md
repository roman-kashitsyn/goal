Go Algorithms Library (`goal`)
==============================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/roman-kashitsyn/goal.png)](https://travis-ci.org/roman-kashitsyn/goal)

This is a Go package which implements most popular algorithms
and data structures.

Graphs:

* Adjacency lists
* Extensible breadth-first and depth-first searches
* Topological sorting
* Shortest path algorithms

Queues:

* Linked queue
* Priority queue

Utilities:

* Bit set

I started this project to improve my algorithm design skills, not for
production purposes. But the routines are still reusable, documented
and well tested.
