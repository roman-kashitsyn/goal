Go Algorithms Library (`goal`)
==============================

This is a Go package which implements most popular algorithms
and data structures, including:

- Graphs
- Balanced Trees
- Search and Sorting
- Priority Queues
- Bloom filter

I started this project to improve my algorithm design skills, not for
production purposes. But the routines are still reusable, documented
and well tested.
