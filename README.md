Go Algorithms Library (`goal`)
==============================

This is a Go package which implements most popular algorithms
and data structures.

Graphs
------
* Adjacency lists
* Extensible breadth-first and depth-first searches
* Topological sorting

Queues
------
* Linked queue
* Priority queue

I started this project to improve my algorithm design skills, not for
production purposes. But the routines are still reusable, documented
and well tested.
